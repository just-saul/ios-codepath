## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

-  MyFitnessPal: Knowledge of products, able to share your entry with friends
-  Youtube: Great UI, watch later, history 
-  Instagram: Able to delete messages, save videos/posts
-  Slack: Different channels, organized chats, easy to grasp

- An app that I would love to build would be a cooking app. An app which would recommend new dishes, but not just average dishes, but dishes that are more uncommon! I had the idea the mascott being a capybara, as I have a love for them. The app name would called capyCooks, and challenge cooks depedning on their skill level. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- When building the app, the biggest chanllenge I faced was mainly getting accustomed to the program, Xcodde, and the new coding language.
